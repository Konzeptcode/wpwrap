## WP Wrap

WP Wrap adds an outer and an inner wrap to your blocks

## How does it come?
I ([Talha Sariyürek]) am working in an advertisement company and there we are developing WordPress websites all day. Now we have started to develop our new websites with the Gutenberg Block editor and i personally was missing one important feature.
Normally i add in every block/component based project an outer wrapper and an inner wrapper. Bit this was not the case in the Gutenberg editor so i've decideed to write an open source plugin for that.

## Open Source
You all are free to code it with me and send me an pull request on the [Github Repo].

## Todos

 - Add an function to add custom blocks to wrap (i.e. only paragraph and table block)
 - Add custom class names for each (inner/outer) wrappper

I will try to add this features as soon as possible. Please feel free to send me an pull request if you have added working features.
